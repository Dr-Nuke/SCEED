## 1) Coupling controls with the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of countries



We introduce a risk model to the provided data. The following section describes the model logic. Basically, we filtered by the top half corrupt countries according to the CPI index combined with classical controls:



12'700 hits for the top 5% clients in turnover combined with the top half of CPI ranked country\n

12'700 hits for the top 5% clients in transaction count combined with the top half of CPI ranked countries

23'000 hits for the 0.5 io_ration clients within the top half of corrupt CPI countries

29'000 hits for the unity io_ration clients within the top half of corrupt CPI countries

27'900 hits for the top 5% of old clients

19'900 hits in the top 5% of CPI countries

1'700 hits for publicly exposed persons (PEP) in the top half of CPI countries. 

13'200 hits for the top 5% of clients with shortest maximum inactivity combined with the top half of CPI countries

12'600 hits for the top 5% of clients with shortest average combined with the top half of CPI countries

80'000 hits for the top 5% of clients with more than 1 bank account

19'300 hits for the top 5% of clients with more than 1 distinct counterparty 

12'600 hits for the top half of atm withdrawls combined with the top half of CPI countries

12'700 hits for the top half of atm deposits combined with the top half of CPI countries
